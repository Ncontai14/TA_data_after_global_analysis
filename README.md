# TA_data_after_global_analysis
Working with the dataset after global analysis of Transient Absorption data.

There are two jupyter notebook files-

Conc_matrix_from_TAS.ipynb is mainly for obtaining the time-dependent concentration change of the excited state species given that you have the transient absorption data matrix and species associated spectra. 

SAS_from_TAS.ipynb is mainly for obtaining the time-dependent concentration change of the excited state species given that you have the transient absorption data matrix and concentration change of the excited state species.
